# Bash Scripts
A few helpful scripts I use to speed-up my workflow

## csv-reader
Displays a .csv file in columns and opens it in `less`. If you're not familiar with `less`, you can navigate with the arrow keys
and quit by pressing "q".

## process-latex
Make sure that you have the `texlive` and `evince` packages installed on your machine. This will take a .tex file, compile it into
a .pdf, then display it with `evince`.
